    <p> This application, is the first step in an iterative design process, with the hopes of completing 
    a program that enables users to take back the power of data colection. Instead of creating recommendations,
    this application aims to allow users to track what or who is negatively impacting their life, such as a work 
    environment, individual aggressor, or negative coping mechanism including self-destructive behaviors, mental or physical 
    discomfort, and addiction.
